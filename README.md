IMDB Sentiment Analysis

This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to classify IMDB movie reviews as either positive or negative. 
The goal is to develop a model that can effectively understand sentiment in text data.
Using a dataset of 50,000 movie reviews, I preprocess the text, extract features using TF-IDF vectorization, and train a Logistic Regression classifier to predict sentiment.
